I'm a Developer experienced in Web technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js). Open-source maintainer and contributor. Knowledgeable in the React ecosystem, from state management techniques and solutions to technologies like Next.js and Remix with deep understanding of their core features such as server-side rendering, routing, and data fetching. Love slick designs and not afraid to write my own CSS. Always advancing with the ever-changing front-end world.
